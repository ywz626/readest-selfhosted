/**
 * Issue #5049 — "web.readest.com after signing in retains the example books".
 *
 * The demo books are the sample shelf an anonymous web visitor gets. They are
 * imported as ordinary url-backed Book rows, so once the user signs in they are
 * indistinguishable from the user's own books:
 *
 *   1. they get pushed to the user's cloud library, and
 *   2. deleting them does not stick — the cloud row never learned about the
 *      tombstone (a delete does not bump `updatedAt`, so the row loses LWW on
 *      the server), and the next pull merges it back over the local row,
 *      clearing `deletedAt`. The resurrected books come back coverless because
 *      the delete cleared `coverDownloadedAt` and there is no cloud cover to
 *      refetch.
 *
 * Demo books are never the user's content: they must stay out of the push, and
 * a cloud row must never write back over one.
