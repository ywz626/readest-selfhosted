/**
 * Tests for the shared bounded-concurrency runner used by nav build,
 * embedded-nav enrichment, and OPDS auto-download. Three properties matter
 * to those callers and are pinned down here:
 *
 *   1. In-flight task count never exceeds the requested cap. The whole
 *      reason this primitive exists is to stop nav build from saturating
 *      the Tauri IPC bridge / fd pool, so a regression here would silently
 *      reintroduce the "Cannot close a ERRORED writable stream" failure
 *      mode on Android.
 *   2. Output is positionally aligned with input even when tasks complete
 *      out of order. OPDS callers index into the result array assuming
 *      `results[i]` is the outcome of `items[i]`.
 *   3. A throwing task does not abort sibling tasks — failures are
 *      surfaced as `{ item, error }` outcomes alongside successes. This
 *      is what lets nav build keep going when one section's inflate
 *      genuinely fails.
