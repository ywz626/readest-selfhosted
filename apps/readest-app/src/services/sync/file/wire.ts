 * sync providers (per-field updatedAt LWW for top-level keys, per-note
 * updatedAt + deletedAt for booknotes). The envelope adds the bare
 * minimum "who/when last wrote this" metadata so clients can detect
 * cross-device clobbers and surface them in diagnostics.
 *
 * FROZEN: `schemaVersion`, `writerVersion`, and the trimmed-config field
 * set are part of the on-wire contract. A refactored client and an old
 * client must interoperate byte-for-byte, so do not rename or re-shape
 * these fields. `writerVersion` keeps its historical `'readest-webdav-1'`
 * value even though the engine is now provider-agnostic — it is an opaque
 * tag, never branched on, and changing it buys nothing.

 * exception is `referencePageCount`, which is book data wearing a view-setting
 * costume; it travels as its own envelope key (see RemoteBookConfig).
 *
 * Why the rest of viewSettings stays local even though it lives in BookConfig:
 *   - Different devices have different screen sizes / DPI / typography
 *     preferences. Pushing a phone's 14pt setting onto a desktop would
 *     surprise users in a bad way.
 *   - readest's own cloud sync similarly carves out viewSettings from
 *     cross-device replication. Duplicating that policy here keeps the
 *     backends behaviourally aligned.
 *   - The trim list below is the SOURCE OF TRUTH for what travels —
 *     when adding a new BookConfig field, decide here whether it's a
 *     "reading state" (include) or a "device preference" (skip).
 *
 * Anything not in `trimmed` therefore never reaches the server, and
 * conversely the config merge (see `mergeBookConfig` in merge.ts) only
 * ever merges fields the server actually carries — so a malicious or
 * buggy server can't somehow inject viewSettings into a local config.
